# 🛠️ Admin Dashboard UI for E-commerce (SaaS Inspired)

This project is a **custom-built Admin Dashboard UI** tailored for e-commerce platforms, including a **Super Admin panel** — ideal for SaaS-like platforms (inspired by Shopify, but completely original in concept and design).

> 🚫 Not a clone — everything is designed from scratch based on my vision and experience.

It uses **mock data** via constants or JSON files, and focuses purely on the **frontend UI/UX**. Ideal for developers who want to explore clean and modern admin interfaces or build upon it for real projects.
